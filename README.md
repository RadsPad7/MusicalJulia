How to use:
The code firstly prompts you to enter what function you want it to perform.
Either to upload your own notes and have them translated, or whether you want to choose from the song ‘library’. After entering your letter,(A, B, or C to exit the program.). If you choose to upload your own file, it prompts you to enter the name of the file.(make sure to enter the extension .txt at the end.) It then reads the file, translates it and asks you what you want to save your converted file as. Follow the same step as earlier. It then tells you where your file is saved. If you go with option ‘B’, it gives you options of songs. You can choose the song and then it will print it in both versions (Indian, and Western) for you. 

There are two extra files(Carnatic, and Western) You may use these files for uploading.
